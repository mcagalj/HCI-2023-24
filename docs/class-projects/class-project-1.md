# Class project 1: Figma essentials

**Project Tasks:**

- Create a simple responsive hero section in Figma; elements/components in your Figma frame should nicely behave as you resize the corresponding parent frame.
- The hero section will include a menu. Make menu items a Figma component.
- Use auto-layout, auto-spacing, constraints features.

**Deliverables:**

- Record a short video (10-20sec) of your hero section frame. Prove that it is responsive and that you can easily change look and feel of menu items. You can use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for recording.
- Upload the video to your repository (use the provided [GitHub repo template](https://github.com/mcagalj/HCI-2023-24-template.git) to organize your files).
