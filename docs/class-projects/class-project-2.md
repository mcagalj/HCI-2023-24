# Class project 2: User personas and information architecture

> In practice, this task requires going outside and talking, interviewing and observing real users in their real environments and contexts. This is how you develop **empathy** in design. To streamline this potentially lengthy process do make use of ChatGPT for your project.

**Project Tasks:**

1. **Create User Personas (3):**
   - Create a set of user personas (3) relevant to a specific project.
   - **Example prompt**: _Develop a user persona for a new web application that sells vegetarian products._

        You can use the [Figma user persona template](https://www.figma.com/templates/user-persona-template/) as a starting point. Do not forget to include AI generated photo for your personas.

2. **Information Architecture and Card Sorting:**
   - Develop an information architecture for your project based on the card sorting method.
   - **Example prompt**: 
     - _What is information architecture in UX design? What is a cart sorting method in UX design?_
     - _Propose a set of 15 topics related to vegetarian products._
     - _Assume the role of persona 1 and categorize and label the proposed topics. Persona 1 represents a category of busy people._
     - _Next, act as persona 2 and run the same task. Persona 2 is health-conscious vegetarian._
     - _Combine the resulting categories for all personas._

3. **Create a Sitemap:**
   - Based on the combined categories from card sorting, design a detailed sitemap for the web application selling vegetarian products. Clearly display the structure and hierarchy of the information on your site.
   - **Example prompt:** _Based on the combined categories propose a detailed sitemap for my web application for selling vegetarian products._

**Deliverables:**

- A document detailing your user personas, including demographic details, personality traits, and context-specific information.
- A visual representation of your sitemap. Include appropriate ChatGPT prompts.
- Upload these deliverables to your repository (use the provided [GitHub repo template](https://github.com/mcagalj/HCI-2023-24-template.git) to organize your files).
