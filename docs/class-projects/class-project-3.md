# Class Project 3: Next.js - Deploying Application

**Project Description:**

In this project, you will leverage the sitemap created in the previous stage to develop a functional web application using Next.js. The focus of this project is on creating template pages, establishing routes, and enabling seamless navigation between pages. Visual design is not a priority.

**Project Tasks:**

1. **Set up Next.js project and implement routing:**
   - Create a new Next.js project.
   - Initialize template pages corresponding to the categories identified in the sitemap.  
   - Define routes for each template page, ensuring alignment with the sitemap structure.
   - Enable navigation between pages. Use Next.js `Link` component for smooth transitions.

2. **Deploy to Vercel or Netlify:**
   - Deploy your early Next.js draft webpage to Vercel or Netlify for public access.
   - Test the navigation.
